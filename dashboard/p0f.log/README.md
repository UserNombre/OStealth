# Dashboard

Streamlit dashboard for p0f.
# OStealth Streamlit Dashboard

This directory contains a **Streamlit-based dashboard** used to visualize and monitor
the behavior of **OStealth** and related fingerprinting tools (such as `p0f`).

⚠️ **Important**:  
This dashboard is **only a frontend / visualization layer**.  
The actual fingerprinting, packet inspection, and spoofing logic happens **outside**
of Streamlit (kernel module, eBPF, system tools).

---

## What this dashboard does

- Displays and visualizes output generated by backend tools (e.g. `p0f`)
- Helps inspect OS fingerprinting behavior
- Provides a user-friendly UI for analysis

It **does NOT**:
- replace `p0f`
- replace `nmap`
- load kernel modules
- perform packet manipulation by itself

---

## System requirements

This project is intended to run on **Kali Linux**.

### Required system tools
These must be installed **outside Python**, using your package manager:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y p0f nmap git python3 python3-venv python3-pip
